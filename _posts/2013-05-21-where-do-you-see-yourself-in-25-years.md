SEP is celebrating its 25th anniversary of being in business.  Employees of all experiences are reminiscing on the past and speculating on the future.

Do you remember when someone (usually a guidance counselor or a potential employer) would ask, "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"  I'm not sure why, but I always hated that question.  There is so much that could happen in one year that could change the current of the stream that is your life, let alone the currents of 5 years and the huge ramifications of 25 years.

The joke goes: "Women marry men hoping that they'll change; men marry women hoping that they'll stay the same."  If you were to ask me "where do you see yourself..." shortly after I got married, I'm positive my answer would <em>not</em> have been, "I see myself coming home to my two sons playing around our backyard."  That just wasn't in the plan I saw.

People change.  Plans change.  Luckily, God doesn't change.
<blockquote>"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever."

- Hebrews 13:8 (HCSB)</blockquote>
I'm not the planner-type, <em>per se</em>.  I try to have a sense that I'm going in the right direction, according to God's will.  I do have some high-level goals like "let's get this house paid off ASAP" and "let's teach our kids the right values with love and understanding and prepare them for life".  However, life is a journey.  The ebbs and flow of life take us to a final destination that only He knows.  Time will tell what happens and how we end up.
<blockquote>"Time is a companion who goes with us on the journey and reminds us to cherish every moment because they'll never come again."

I used that quote in my high school commencement speech (yeah, I have been, and always will be, a <a title="Star Trek fan" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trekkie#Trekkie_vs._Trekker" target="_blank">Trekker</a>), and it has proven to be timeless to me.  From the highs and lows of teenage years, to marriage and children, there are plenty of things to cherish.  I'm amazed at how my oldest boys are growing up to be such smart and talented young men.  I'm reminded sometimes of the elders in my life that won't be around forever.  Even though I may complain about all the pictures hanging up that put holes in our walls, they remind me of all the good memories we've cherished along the way (but don't tell my wife I said that).

"Where do you see yourself in 25 years?"  I hope that by the grace of God I am still on this journey of life with my beautiful bride and my grown children (the oldest of whom will be about the same age as I am now).  Perhaps some grandchildren to keep me young.  Working at SEP (or whatever manifestation it is then) where I'll feel old.  Doing good for His kingdom.  Maybe even a <a title="Flying Car" href="http://www.terrafugia.com/" target="_blank">flying</a> <a title="BTTF 2 future" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future_Part_II#Depiction_of_the_future" target="_blank">car</a>.
